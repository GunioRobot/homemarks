Some Miscellaneous Notes:
------------------------------------------------------------------

  * Plugins Installed
    - Shoulda => https://svn.thoughtbot.com/plugins/shoulda/tags/rel-4.0.1/  
  
  * There is a configuration class in environment.rb. It is used 
    alot throughout the app. Some things may beed to be set there 
    on first install.
  
  * The app makes pretty decent (filesystem) use of fragment 
    cachine. The store can be changed to a (db) store. Please 
    take a look at the cache_masters.rb file.
  
  * The application includes a utility script in lib/utilities. 
    An example of a use in production would be to scrip this with 
    cron or launchd:
    
    env RAILS_ENV=production /pathtoyourapp/current/script/runner DemoUser.reset
