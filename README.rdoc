== HomeMarks: Simple Bookmark Start Page

A simple application that allows you to create your own customized HTML start 
by creating and sorting Columns, Boxes, and Bookmarks. The application even has 
a JavaScript bookmarklet that can be used to create bookmarks from any 
destination.

HomeMarks was built by using the Ruby on Rails framework with a heavy emphasis 
on object oriented JavaScript and AJAX, using both the Prototype and Scriptacoulous 
JavaScript libraries. It was made by me, Ken Collins, as my first pet project while 
learning the Rails framework (pre 1.0) and has now been rewritten from the ground 
up for the release of Rails 2.1. I hope that you find it useful.


=== INSTALLATION

Simply download and/or clone the repository and run the app:bootstrap task.

    $ rake app:bootstrap

The rake task assumes that you will be running HomeMarks from your own local
computer. The databases will use SQLite3 (rails default) and the following 
information is requested.

* The host and port you will use locally to access the app.
* Email and password. Used to create your HomeMarks account.

It is suggested that you setup a named host in your host file vs using the 
script/server default of 0.0.0.0:3000.


=== Running Tests

HomeMarks uses the shoulda testing plugin by Thoughtbot. The git repository is 
already tracking shoulda as a submodule. Simply do the following from the root 
of your HomeMarks checkout:

    $ git submodule init
    $ git submodule update
